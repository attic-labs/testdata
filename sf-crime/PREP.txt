How these files were prepared:

- Download from https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/SFPD-Incidents-from-1-January-2003
  - Download the "excel csv format" (which is actually tab-delimited haha!)
- sort the csv textually:
  - capture the header: head -n1 file.csv > head.csv 
  - use `wc -l` to get the number of lines in the output
  - use `tail -n<output of previous minus 1> > | sort newfile.csv` to sort the lines not including the header
  - use `cat head.csv newfile.csv > newfile2.csv`
  - remove all the temp files
